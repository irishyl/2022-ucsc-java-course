/**
 * This is solution for Homework#6
 * 
 * All solutions have been put in one place to minimize
 * number of classes
 * 
 * The solution combines what was done in homework #6.1 in separate class
 * In this solution the solutions of homework #6.2 is combined in one class
 * and tested from one main method.
